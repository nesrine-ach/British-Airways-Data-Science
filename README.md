# British-Airways-Data-Science
This repository contains my own attempt for the Data Science Virtual Experience Program with British Airways and theforage. The program consisted of two tasks that focused on using data science and machine learning techniques to analyze customer feedback data and predict customer behavior.

## Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis
For the first task, I used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer feedback data collected from various sources. I performed topic modeling using the LDA algorithm and sentiment analysis to uncover insights, and then created visualizations to communicate these insights effectively.
## Task 2: Customer Behavior Prediction
For the second task, I trained a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of customers buying holidays. I evaluated the model's performance and analyzed how each variable contributed to the model's power, using feature importances.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank British Airways and theforage for providing this virtual experience program and the opportunity to apply my skills in data science and machine learning to a real-world scenario.
